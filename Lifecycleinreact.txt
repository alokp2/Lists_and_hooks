Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks

Class components also have methods that hook into React’s rendering and re-rendering cycles called lifecycle method. Many methods are now deprecated or considered UNSAFE as the React team is pushing forward with functional components  and hooks. 

There are three main phases of any React component:

1. The mounting phase when a component is created and inserted into the DOM. This is the initial render and only happens once in a components lifecycle.
2. The updating phase is when a component re-renders due to updates. This happens either due to *prop* changes or *state* changes.
3. The final phase is the un-mounting phase, when a component is removed from the DOM.
